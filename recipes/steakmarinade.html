      the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor.

    <h2>Steak Marinade Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Oil: This top-rated steak marinade recipe starts with olive oil, which
        keeps the meat nice and moist.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauces: You'll need Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Hot sauce is
        optional, but it's a great addition for people who appreciate a little
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lemon juice: The acidity from the lemon juice cuts through the other
        flavors, adding welcome brightness. The acid also helps tenderize the
        meat even further.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices and seasonings: This flavorful marinade is seasoned with dried
        basil, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, white pepper, and minced
