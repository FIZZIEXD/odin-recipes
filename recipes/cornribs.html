    <h3>
      Corn ribs will make you forget everything you know about eating corn on
      the cob—and will, without a doubt, become your favorite way of making
      corn.
    </h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Some would argue this method is so amazing and makes eating corn on the
      cob so pleasurable, that losing a fingertip is a fair trade.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Once cut, you can season and cook your corn ribs any way you want. But no
      matter which way you go, this is unlike any other “on the cob” experience
      you've ever had.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Since we're just dealing with a quarter of a cob, our teeth can reach all
      the way around the “bone,” which means easily biting off every single
      kernel.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li><p>4 ears fresh corn, shucked</p></li>
      <li><p>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p></li>
      <li><p>4 tablespoons melted butter</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir together salt, chili powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, cumin,
          garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a small bowl; set aside.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Using a sharp knife, trim off both ends of each ear of corn to expose
          the cob. Stand cob on end, and carefully cut corn in half down the
          exact center of the cob, rocking the knife while applying downward
          pressure from the top. Stand each cob half on end, and cut into
          quarters using the same method. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Drizzle oil over corn; sprinkle on about 2/3 of spice mixture. Toss
          well, being sure to smear spices and oil evenly over each rib.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Ribs can now be finished on a charcoal grill, until hot and well
          browned.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          To finish indoors, preheat the oven's broiler and set a rack 7 to 8
          inches from the heating element. Line a baking pan with foil.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Arrange corn ribs on the prepared pan with the maximum number of
          kernels facing up, toward the heat. Extra foil can be placed on the
          pan to prop up ribs into the right position. Once arranged, sprinkle
          with more spice mixture if so desired.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Broil on High until corn starts to brown in spots, about 7 minutes.
          Remove and rearrange ribs as needed, so that areas of kernels that are
          not yet browned are facing up toward the heat, and continue to broil
          until corn is golden-brown with some charred spots, 7 to 8 minutes
          more.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p>Remove and brush with melted butter.</p></li>
