    <h3>
      This blueberry pie, made with fresh berries, is a beautiful sight with a
      lattice top.
    </h3>

    <p class="paragraph">Nothing screams "summer" quite like blueberry pie.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients needed:</h2>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li>
        <p>
          Sugar: This blueberry pie recipe starts with a cup of white sugar.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cornstarch: Cornstarch thickens the blueberry pie filling, preventing
          runniness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon adds subtle warmth.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the blueberry pie
          filling, but it won't make it taste salty.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Blueberries: Of course, you'll need fresh blueberries! If you can't
          find fresh, frozen (and thawed) will work.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Pie crust: Use a store-bought or homemade pastry crust.</p></li>
      <li><p>Butter: You'll need just a tablespoon of butter.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li><p>¾ cup white sugar</p></li>
      <li><p>3 tablespoons cornstarch</p></li>
      <li><p>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p></li>
      <li><p>¼ teaspoon salt</p></li>
      <li><p>4 cups fresh blueberries</p></li>
      <li><p>1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</p></li>
      <li><p>1 tablespoon butter</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>
        Set an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 375
        degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; sprinkle
        over blueberries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a pie dish with one pie crust. Pour berry mixture into the crust
        and dot with butter. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide
        strips. Use the strips to weave a lattice top. Crimp and flute the
        edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pie on the lowest oven rack until filling is bubbling and crust is
        golden brown, about 50 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
